## Open Tutor
This repository contains the code for the frontend of the OpenTutor application. You can check out the backend [here](https://github.com/kz4killua/opentutor-backend). 

## What does it do?
Open Tutor analyzes the contents of a textbook, research paper, assignment, or even magazine, and steps the learner through the content. Rather than having to deal with a huge mess of confusing text, Open Tutor breaks down difficult material into simple easy-to-digest modules. After completing each module, you get a chance to test your knowledge with evaluation questions. Plus, you have a personal AI tutor that can answer any questions and guide you along the way. 

## What technologies were used?
The frontend application is written in React (Next.js) and Tailwind CSS (❤️). Shout out to Chakra UI.

## Can I run Open Tutor on my machine? 
Absolutely! Follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have installed Node JS on your machine. Follow the steps here: https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal. 
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies. 
4. Copy the *.env.local* file into the root project directory. You can modify the backend URL from this file. Take a look at the `.env.example` file for some help.
5. Run `npm run dev`. This will start the server at localhost:3000
6. You probably want to run the backend application as well. Head over to the [backend repository](https://github.com/kz4killua/opentutor-backend) and follow the steps there too. 

# Can I contribute?
